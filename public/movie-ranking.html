<h1>The Best Movies According to Kyle</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time:</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Home Alone</h3>
<p>This is number one on my list of favorite movies. This movie is so nostalgic
    for me and brings back many memories of my childhood. The Christmas setting
    makes it a perfect movie to watch during the holidays.

<h3>The Help</h3>
<p>I'm a huge fan of historical fiction, so this movie is at the top of my list.
    Segregation is a huge part of our history and this movie puts that all into
    perspective.

<h3>Finding Nemo</h3>
<p>There's just something about adorable fish and Disney movies that I can't get 
    seem to stop watching. Disney movies also bring me back to my childhood and this 
    movie is one of those.
